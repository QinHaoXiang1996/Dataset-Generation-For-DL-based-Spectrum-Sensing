# Dataset Generation for DL based Spectrum Sensing
 *Source code for dataset generation of paper "Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio: A Deep Learning Based Model" *our dataset generation source is based on the method in "T. O’Shea and N. West, “Radio machine learning dataset generation with gnu radio,” in Proc. GNU Radio Conference (GRCon16), vol. 1, 2016."(https://github.com/radioML/dataset).

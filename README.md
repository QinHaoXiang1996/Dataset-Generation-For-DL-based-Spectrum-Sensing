# Dataset Generation for DL based Spectrum Sensing
*Source code for dataset generation of paper "Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio: A Deep Learning Based Model" 

*our dataset generation source is based on the method in "T. O’Shea and N. West, “Radio machine learning dataset generation with gnu radio,” in Proc. GNU Radio Conference (GRCon16), vol. 1, 2016."(https://github.com/radioML/dataset).

*dataset_generation.py is the main program for dataser generation

*source_material, analyze_stats.py, source_alphabet.py, timeseries_slicer and transmitters.py are given by the source code of "T. O’Shea and N. West, “Radio machine learning dataset generation with gnu radio,” in Proc. GNU Radio Conference (GRCon16), vol. 1, 2016."

*For source_material,  "T. O’Shea and N. West, “Radio machine learning dataset generation with gnu radio,” in Proc. GNU Radio Conference (GRCon16), vol. 1, 2016." gives the following description: For digitalmodulations, we use the entire Gutenberg works of Shakespeare in ASCII, with whitening randomizers applied to ensure equiprobable symbols and bits. All of our modems then use these two data sources with the corresponding digital or analog data source.

*analyze_stats.py, source_alphabet.py, timeseries_slicer and transmitters.py are used to signal simulation, which are described minutely in "T. O’Shea and N. West, “Radio machine learning dataset generation with gnu radio,” in Proc. GNU Radio Conference (GRCon16), vol. 1, 2016."
